# Objects and Functions in JavaScript

- #### Objects
 - It's a collection dynamic of property
 - It's defined with key and value
   - Key: Is possible in the definition to be with String or Symbol
   - Value: Is possible whatever data type
 - Possilities of creation Objects
   - Literal notation: {}
   - Constructor function: new Object()
   - Method create the Object API: Object.create(null)
 - It's possible to use the same name used for Key and Value. The name for this operation is shorthand.
   - Example:  const name=’test’; const obj = { name };
 - Depending on the declaration of key is necessary to declare it's a String.
   - Example: const obj = {"name-of-prop": 123};
 - It's possible to use keys in time of execution
 - It's possible to assign properties to objects through their reference
 - It's possible to access it's values directly
 - #### Undefined and null
   - A queried variable returns the type undefined when the key is not found.
   - What the difference in the types undefined and null?
     - The undefined type is used when variable is not found.
     - The null when can intentionallity to say thet there is an absence of any value for that variable.
   - Never assign null or undefined, if the intention is delete a property, to use the operator delete
 - #### Comparison of objects
   - When is compared an object, it's done through its reference. Even if the two objects is equals keys and values, they will be considered differents.
   - One way is to go through analyzing each key and value if the two objects are equivalent.
   - For the guarantee that the objects compared objects are equivalent, it's necessary to verify their prototypes.
 - #### inheritance
   - The main purpose the inheritance is the code reuse, decreasing the duplication code.
   - The inheritance in JavaScript is performed for objects and not class, as others languages.
   - `__proto__`: The property is a reference for the object prototype.
   - Why the property not print if has in other tier?
     - In order not to have enviroment with polluted information, the system undestands that it should not display prop in the pattern of what it inrerits.
   - Object.setPrototypeOf: To allow the interaction with the object prototype for set the object that will inherit the property informed in second parameter
   - Object.create: Creates a obejct the passing the its prototype as a parameter. Be careful with the Object.create and to pass it as a value null, it will lose some aperations, example hasOwnProperty;
   - If the property exists in both the object and the prototype, the object's own property is returned, making the shadow to the property prototype.
 - #### Object API
   - Object.assign: Copies the properties of the objects passed by parameter for the taget object, which is returned;
   - Object.keys: Returns the keys of the properties of object;
   - Object.values: Returns the values of the properties ob object;
   - Object.entries: Returns properties in pairs, represented with keys and values;
   - Object.is: Compares two objectsconsidering the data types similarly to the equivalent operator (===);
   - defineProperty: Defines a property, being possible to configure the its edition, or else its visualition. Having the following properties:
     - configurable: Allows which a given property to be cleared;
     - enumerable: Allows which a given property to be enumerated;
     - value: Sets the values of a given property;
     - writable: Allows which a given property have its value modified;
  - preventExtensions, seal and freeze:
     - Object.preventExtensions: Prevent which the object has news properties, but allows to modify or removing existing properties;
     - Object.seal: Prevent which the object has news properties or delete existing properties, but allows to modify existing properties;
     - Object.freeze: Prevent which the object has news properties, delete or modify existing properties;
 
 
     | Method | Create | Read | Update | Delete |
     | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
     | preventExtensions | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
     | seal | No | Yes | Yes | No |
     | freeze | No | Yes | No | No |

 - #### JSON
   - Javascript Object Notation;
   - Is a data interchange format, derived the JavaScript language;
   - Discovered by Douglas Crockford;
   - standardized by ECMA-404;
   - What is JSON used for?
     - Used as an alternative to XML, for the data tranference structured between systems
   - Data types: Number, String, Boolean Object, Array and null;
   - JSON.stringfy: Converts a determined data type for JSON;
   - JSON.parse: Converts a JSON for a determined data type;
   - JSON and Object are two completely different concepts;
 - #### Function
   - A function is an object which contains an executable block code;
   - What is the difference between function declaration and expression?
     - The main difference is between the preload order. The function declaration hoist the function for its pre-loading,being able to call it even before its declaration. The function expression is not accept, as its use can only be below its declaration. this is called 'hoisting'.
   - The functions are firs class, that is, they can be assingned the a variable, passed by parameters or returned from another function;
   - It's possible to invoke a function with fewer or more paratemeter, not necessary following what's declared
   - Can set default values for each of a function's parameters
   - Through the implicit variable arguments it is possible to access the parameters of the invoked function
   - It is also possible to access the parameters of the invoked function through the rest parameter.
   - The rest parameter must always be the last parameter in the list of parameters
 - __this:__ There is an implicit variable called of 'this' that make reference to the object responsible for its invocation;
 - __getter and setter__
   - They serve for to intercept the access to the properties of a given object;
   - Use different keys for the function and the object property;
   - Through the object APIdefineProperty operation, it's also possible to define getter and setter functions;
 - #### call, apply and bind
   - Through the operations call and apply is possible to invoke a function passing the 'this' as parameter;
   - What's the diffence between call and apply?
     - The difference is in receiving the parameters. In call, receivs the variable as needed. Using apply you will have to pass it as an array;
   - The bind operation operation allows you to encapsulate this within the function returning it;
 - #### new 
   - It allows which creates a new by classes and function;
   - The object is to reuse more the same structure more;
   - The factory function, is a standard type, returns a new object after has invoked directly
   - What do for to eliminate the duplication and to reuse properties betwen the objects?
     - This would happen using the concept already learned, *inheritance*
   - The constructor function returns a new object when invoked via the operator new
   - Every function has a property called prototype, which is linked to the `__proto__`
   - Don't forget of to use the new operator when using constructor functions
 - #### instanceof
   - Is possible to verify if an object was created through a certain constructor function by analyzing its chain of prototypes
   - What's the difference between the typeof and the instanceof?
     - typeof: Returns the data type the variable analyzed
     - instanceof: Compare the chain of prototype if the variable compares at some pont is the type being compared;
 - #### Arrow function
   - Has a simpler and more straightforward approach to writing a function and can improve code readability in many situations;
   - The Arrows Functions don't have the its own variables this and arguments;
 - #### Execution Context
   - Is the environment when the code is executed, consisting of the variable object,scope chain and this;
   - Within a function, it's possible to access variables that exist outside of it, through the scope chain;
   - It's not possible to access a variable that was declared inside a function from outside;
   - Every function has a variable 'this' that contains the reference to the object for its invocation;
     - #### Closures
       - The language JavaScript all function allows the use of variables that have not been declared or passed as a parameter;
       - The problem is that as the functions are the first class, depending on the situation there could be an ambiguity this was solved with the closure concept;
       - in short, a closure is a function with with a static scope chain that is defined at the time the function is created, so all functions in the JavaScript language are closures;
       - Although static the scope chain references objects that are in memory and can be shared by more than one function;
